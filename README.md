## NoteDogOMR Privacy Policy

This application does not intentionally collect, store, or transmit personally identifiable information.

This application requests access to the camera ability of camera-enabled devices.  If permission is granted by the user to use the camera, the camera can be used to take pictures.  The intent of the application is that pictures be of sheet music.  However, the application does not control what content a person takes pictures of, and assumes no liability for any pictures that are taken of sheet music or otherwise.

These pictures are stored on the phone in a directory that is viewable by other applications just like the standard camera application.  Therefore, these pictures might be shared with others if the smartphone itself supports sharing capability such as email or texting. The application does not implement its own custom, data sharing capability.
